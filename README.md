# LifeGen
This Python code is designed to implement a genetic algorithm (GA) for optimizing ambulance routing in emergency situations within a grid-based environment. The primary objective is to efficiently respond to emergency calls by assigning ambulances optimal routes while considering factors such as patient severity, blocked areas, and traffic signals.
